# CV

This is my curriculum vitae.
It is written in static files,
trying to keep a proper separation
between the data, the templates
and the styles.

There's a small extra effort
on showing my knowledge on the latest
trends, such as ES6 features, PWA
and CSS3 responsiveness.

If you're willing to read it, I hope you enjoy it.
