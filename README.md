# CV

[Read here my curriculum vitae](https://gatsbimantico.github.io/cv).
It is written in static files,
trying to keep a proper separation between
  the data,
  the templates
and
  the styles
.

There's a small extra effort on
showing my knowledge on the latest trends, such as
  ES6 features,
  PWA
and
  CSS3 responsiveness
.

If you're willing to read it,
I hope you enjoy it.

Cheers,
Cesar.
